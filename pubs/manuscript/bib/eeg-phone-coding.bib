  abstract = {An overview of the basic ideas of articulatory phonology is presented, along with selected examples of phonological patterning for which the approach seems to provide a particularly insightful account. In articulatory phonology, the basic units of phonological contrast are gestures, which are also abstract characterizations of articulatory events, each with an intrinsic time or duration. Utterances are modeled as organized patterns (constellations) of gestures, in which gestural units may overlap in time. The phonological structures defined in this way provide a set of articulatorily based natural classes. Moreover, the patterns of overlapping organization can be used to specify important aspects of the phonological structure of particular languages, and to account, in a coherent and general way, for a variety of different types of phonological variation. Such variation includes allophonic variation and fluent speech alternations, as well as 'coarticulation' and speech errors. Finally, it is suggested that the gestural approach clarifies our understanding of phonological development, by positing that prelinguistic units of action are harnessed into (gestural) phonological structures through differentiation and coordination.},

  abstract = {Proposes an event approach to a theory of speech perception and speech production, focusing on the perception of speech events (i.e., a talker's phonetically structured articulations). In defining a speech event interchangeably from the perspectives of talkers and listeners, the author adopts a "direct realist" perspective: Perception is assumed to recover events in the real world. To do this, perception must be direct and unmediated by cognitive processes of inference or hypothesis testing. Barriers to the theory are outlined and evidence presented to refute them. Support for direct perception of local, short-term events and longer ones is discussed. Attention is also given to the way in which perception of a linguistic message guides a listener's behavior. Differences in the reliability of the information conveyed between direct and indirect perception and the implications for the relation between an utterance and what it signified are examined.

Accordingly, their own account of the collection of findings on rate normalization is not viable. Their comments on my research do not imperil my interpretation of it or challenge my criticism that classification judgments of acoustically analogous speech and nonsense signals do not permit interpretation, by themselves, in terms of underlying auditory-system mechanisms. Their arguments that in auditory perception, uniquely, we hear proximal stimulation, not its physical causal sources, is implausible. Their theoretical perspective generally, I argue, is unrealistic.},

  volume = {21},
  issn = {0140-525X},
  abstract = {Advanced perceptual systems are faced with the problem of securing a principled (ideally, veridical) relationship between the world and its internal representation. I propose a unified approach to visual representation, addressing the need for superordinate and basic-level categorization and for the identification of specific instances of familiar categories. According to the proposed theory, a shape is represented internally by the responses of a small number of tuned modules, each broadly selective for some reference shape, whose similarity to the stimulus it measures. This amounts to embedding the stimulus in a low-dimensional proximal shape space spanned by the outputs of the active modules. This shape space supports representations of distal shape similarities that are veridical as Shepard's (1968) second-order isomorphisms (i.e., correspondence between distal and proximal similarities among shapes, rather than between distal shapes and their proximal representations). Representation in terms of similarities to reference shapes supports processing (e.g., discrimination) of shapes that are radically different from the reference ones, without the need for the computationally problematic decomposition into parts required by other theories. Furthermore, a general expression for similarity between two stimuli, based on comparisons to reference shapes, can be used to derive models of perceived similarity ranging from continuous, symmetric, and hierarchical ones, as in multidimensional scaling (Shepard 1980), to discrete and nonhierarchical ones, as in the general contrast models (Shepard \& Arabie 1979; Tversky 1977).},
