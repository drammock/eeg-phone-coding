# Setup before subject arrives
## MARLO
- Turn on MARLO and TDT
- Open run script in Spyder
- Move booth keyboard/mouse aside 
- Deploy the cone of silence and "quiet" door signs
## EEG (if you know head size in advance)
- connect EEG electrodes to cap
- connect actiBattery to actiChAmp, connect actiChAmp
- start pyCorder, load config "binaural_cortical" (32 ch, 1000 Hz)
- EEG recording filename: jsalt_binaural_cortical_XX_YYY.eeg
  (replace XX with participant code and YYY with session number, e.g., IJ_001)

In this experiment we will use EEG to record how your brain responds to
different speech sounds. Have you had an EEG before?
	[ EEG uses electrodes on the scalp to detect the electrical activity
	  in your brain; no electricity is sent into your scalp through the
	  electrodes. ]

You don't have to pay special attention to the speech sounds or respond in any
way; in fact, we will play short animated films for you to watch, so just sit
comfortably, try not to fidget too much, and enjoy the cartoons.

Because you'll be connected up to the EEG recorder, it's easiest if you can
make it through the whole experiment without leaving the booth, so if you need
to get a drink or use the bathroom, please do it before we start. If at any time
during the experiment you _do_ need to leave the booth, there is a button on the
table you can use to alert us, and we'll come in and unhook you.

Any questions?
