# [ɹ] is an unstressed allophone of /ə/ (p. 22)
# features for [j] and [w] not given in source; these merely duplicate /i/ and /u/
# voicing features are considered redundant for English and are not given in the appendix table
# in each case, the feature names are paired terms; a feature value of 1 corresponds to the first element of the pair
# on /h/ and /∅/ being grave: acuteness is due to smaller and more compartmented oral cavities (p. 30)
# on nasals being lax: rationale is that tense/lax is coxtensive with voicing in consonants in English
# features for /l/ were assumed to be the same as /ɹ/ whenever it was unclear how the definitions applied
